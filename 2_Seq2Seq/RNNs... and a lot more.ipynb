    "## RNNs Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are designed to make use of sequential data, when the current step has some kind of relation with the previous steps. This makes them ideal for applications with a time component (audio, time-series data) and natural language. RNNs are networks for which value of a unit depends on its own previous output as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is a sequence of letters, words, sentences, paragraphs, etc. These units are not independent. When we comprehend and produce spoken language, we are processing continuous input streams of indefinite\n",
    "length. And even when dealing with written text we normally read it sequentially. Thus, RNNs is a perfect fit to model language data because with RNNs we can represent language sequence of any length into a fixed-sized vector.\n",
    " \n",
    "An input vector representing the current input element $x_t$ is multiplied by a weight matrix $W$ and then passed through an activation function to compute an activation value for a layer of hidden units. This hidden layer is, in turn, used to calculate a corresponding output, $y_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$h_t = g(Uh_{t-1}+Wx_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_t = a(Vh_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer from the previous time step $h_{t-1}$ provides a form of memory, or context, that encodes earlier processing and informs the decisions to be made at later points in time. $U$ determine how the network should make use of past context. RNNs do not impose any limit on this prior context. The context includes information dating back to the beginning of the sequence. Three sets of weights are updated at each timestep: $W$, $U$ and $V$.\n",

    "## RNNs for Text Classification Task\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variations of RNN’s likely Many-One, Many-Many, etc. We will work with a popular classification task of sentiment analysis, the extraction of the sentiment that a writer expresses toward something he/she describes.\n In our case we aim to classify the input text into positivem, negative or neutral class. For example, a positive sentence \"I loved the movie\", a negative \"I hated the movie\" and a neutral \"The movie was about Australia\". So, set of Many-One LSTM units achieves the task as only one value needs to be outputted for determining the polarity of the review. Usually this is the last RNN hidden state as the one that summarises the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why RNNs better than FFNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "FFNNs do not take context into account. Each word is represented by its embedding independent of other words. RNNs encodes each new word (token) considering the previous words. Meaning of words can change depending on the context. For example, compare the meanings of the word \"mean\" in those two sentences \"I compute the mean\" and \"His behaviour was mean\".\n",

    "Language model is required to represent the text to a form understandable from the machine point of view. Language Modelling (LM) is at the core of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Base of all the NLP tasks: Machine Translation, Spell Correction, Speech Recognition, Summarization, Question Answering, Sentiment analysis etc. LMs are used to represent language sequences or generate them.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main difference that word embeddings do not take into account word order. Language models take word order into account. The word order is important. If you do not take the word order into account the representation of the following sentences will be the same: \"It was really not good, on the opposite quite bad.\" and \"It was really not bad, on the opposite quite good.\" However, the meaning of those two sentences is different.\n",

    "You may have heard about BERT. BERT is a general-purpose pre-trained language model. It is pre-trained using a lot of language data from Internet to create a better \"grasp\" of language. It is bidirectional. This means a deeper sense of language context and flow compared to the single-direction language models. You can download it and fine-tune for your NLP problem. BERT will be covered in the last class of this course."

If the gradient becomes vanishingly small over longer distances we can not capture the dependency to the past correctly.
