    "## RNNs Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs are designed to make use of sequential data, when the current step has some kind of relation with the previous steps. This makes them ideal for applications with a time component (audio, time-series data) and natural language. RNNs are networks for which value of a unit depends on its own previous output as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "An input vector representing the current input element $x_t$ is multiplied by a weight matrix $W$ and then passed through an activation function to compute an activation value for a layer of hidden units. This hidden layer is, in turn, used to calculate a corresponding output, $y_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$h_t = g(Uh_{t-1}+Wx_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_t = a(Vh_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hidden layer from the previous time step $h_{t-1}$ provides a form of memory, or context, that encodes earlier processing and informs the decisions to be made at later points in time. $U$ determine how the network should make use of past context. RNNs do not impose any limit on this prior context. The context includes information dating back to the beginning of the sequence. Three sets of weights are updated at each timestep: $W$, $U$ and $V$.\n",

    "## RNNs for Text Classification Task\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many variations of RNN’s likely Many-One, Many-Many, etc. In our case we aim to classify the input text into positive and negative class. So, set of Many-One LSTM units achieves the task as only one value needs to be outputted for determining the polarity of the review. Usually this is the last RNN hidden state as the one that summarises the whole sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why RNNs better than FFNNs?\n",
    "\n",
    "FFNNs do not take context into account. Each word is represented by its embedding independent of other words. RNNs encodes each new word (token) considering the previous words. Meaning of words can change depending on the context. For example, compare the meanings of the word \"mean\" in those two sentences \"I compute the mean\" and \"His behaviour was mean\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How the model is evaluated ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural choise is accuracy - \n",
    "percentage of all the examples that our model labeled correctly. However, it is not good for unbalanced datasets. Imagine a dataset with 999,900 positive examples and 100 negative examples. A very bad classifier can assign positive class to all the examples. This classifier would have 999,900 true negatives and only 100 false negatives and an accuracy of\n",
    "999,900/1,000,000 or 99.99%! \n",
    "\n",
    "Other metrics, more useful for such datasets are: precision, recall and F-measure. Precision measures the percentage of the items that the system labelled as positive and are positive accroding to the gold labels. Recall measures the percentage of items labelled as positive out of all the gold positive items. F-score is the weighted harmonic mean of the precision and recall. \n",

Base of all the NLP tasks: Machine Translation, Spell Correction, Speech Recognition, Summarization, Question Answering, Sentiment analysis etc.  \n",

    "The main difference that word embeddings do not take into account word order. Language models take word order into account. The word order is important. If you do not take the word order into account the representation of the following sentences will be the same: \"It was really not good, on the opposite quite bad.\" and \"It was really not bad, on the opposite quite good.\" However, the meaning of those two sentences is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard about BERT. BERT is a general-purpose pre-trained language model. It is pre-trained using a lot of language data from Internet to create a better \"grasp\" of language. It is bidirectional. This means a deeper sense of language context and flow compared to the single-direction language models. You can download it and fine-tune for your NLP problem. \n",

N-gram is simply a sequence of N words within a given window and when computing the N-grams you typically move one word forward. Typically values between of N between 1 and 5 are considered. According to the formula $m = N-n+1$, in the sentence \"I like chocolate and vanilla ice cream\" there are:\n",

BLEU computes geometirc mean and is a document-level metric: if a higher order n-gram precision (e.g., n = 4) of a sentence is 0, then the BLEU score of the entire sentence is 0, even if some lower order n-grams are matched:\n",
