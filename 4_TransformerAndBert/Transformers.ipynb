    "The Transformer is a non-recurrent model which has achieved SoTA results in sequence-to-sequence transduction problems. It is based entirely on attention. The recurrent nature of RNNs means that parallelisation is not possible as every hidden state relies on the hidden state before it. Impressively, because the Transformer is based on FCNNs, the possibility of parallelising the model is possible.\n",

    "Think back to our Seq2Seq model from last week. During decoding, we have access to the whole source sentence, and the decoded tokens we've decoded SO FAR. Obviously we can't have access to future tokens because we don't know what they are yet...\n",
    "\n",
    "During training time however, we DO have access to future tokens because we have labelled pairs. To speed up training, the Transformer architecture enables us to feed in our whole target sequence to the model and use masking to tell the attention mechanism not to look at illegal (i.e. future) positions when considering the i'th token.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall what Multihead Attention (MHA) did. It worked out a representation for each token in the sequence given all the tokens. In other words, it was bidirectional. Masking is the strategy we use to tell the network not to look at the positions past the most recent word that has been decoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the Decoder Layer in its entirety in a bit, but for now let's focus on the masking process for MHA. We will implement this in our `MultiHeadAttention` module. Our mask is going to be the same shape as `Q_K_matmul` because this is what we are calculating attention over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mask is a tensor with with a value of `-inf` at illegal locations. For one sample in our input, the shape of `Q_K_matumul` is `[T, T]`. Here, `T` refers to the sequence length of the target output. We will talk about test time later, so let's consider the training case right now. During training, we have access to the whole target sequence. So at every timestep (i.e. for every word) in the sequence, an illegal location would be all the future timesteps that we're not meant to have access to. Our matrix is `[T, T]`. So at the 1st timestep, we don't have access to any words from the 2nd timestep onwards. At the 2nd timestep, we don't have acess to any words from the 3rd timestep onwards."

    "\n",
    "So far, we've looked at tokenizing inputs primarily on whitespace and some punctuation rules. __Byte-Pair Encoding__ (BPE) is a conceptually simple and elegant unsupervised technique which allows us to be composable with our tokens while reducing the vocabulary size. It enables us to identify common 'patterns' in natural language and split on that pattern. What we mean by pattern here is common sequences of characters. For example, consider the sentence: `\"They learned byte pair encoding successfully\"`. There are some words in this sentence which contain common sequences of characters:\n",
    "- learned -> learn + _ed_\n",
    "- encoding -> encod + _ing_\n",
    "- successfully -> success + _ful_ + _ly_\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say we had a list of all the common patterns in language (e.g. `[ed, ing, ful, ly]`). Composing our BPE corpus is relatively trivial. For every word in our corpus, we would check if the common pattern was present in that word, and if it is, our tokens for that one word become the root of the word and the patterns in that word. A special symbol (here, `@@`) is used to indicate the start or end of of a sub-word. So given that example sentence above, tokenizing it via BPE gives:\n",
