    "# Introduction to NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "_Natural language processing_ (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. There are a wide variety of tasks that NLP covers, such as Translation, Natural Language Generation, Entity Detection, Sentiment Classification, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research into NLP started in the 50s. Even though today's systems are (obviously) vastly better than what they were previously, NLP is still considered \"unsolved\" and modern research is evolving at a rapid pace. One facet as to why it is challenging is due to the ambiguity of language. For example, the word \"mean\" has multiple definitions: \"signify\", \"unkind\", and \"average\". We also find ourselves using idioms a lot in language - phrases for which the meaning doesn't directly represent sequence of words (e.g. over the moon). Specifically looking at translation, word order differences also prove to be a problem:\n",
    "- DE: Gestern bin ich in London gewesen\n",
    "- Word-By-Word EN: ‘Yesterday have I to London been’\n",
    "- Ground Truth EN: Yesterday I have been to London \n",
    "\n",
    "The history of NLP can essentially be broken down into three approaches: Rule-based, Statistical, and Neural:\n",
    "- Rule-based (1950 - 1999)\n",
    " - Hand-crafted rules to model linguistic intuitions \n",
    "- Corpus-based \n",
    " - Example-based (EBMT) - MT Translation by analogy: if this segment has been translated before, copy its translation\n",
    " - Statistical (2000-2015)\n",
    "   - Statistical models used to push the “translation by analogy” paradigm to its extreme \n",
    "   - Language-independent\n",
    "   - Low cost\n",
    " - Neural - a.k.a. Deep learning (2014-)\n",
    "   - Learning __representations (features) & models__ from data\n",
    "   \n",
    "Neural approaches to NLP in particular allow us to solve the following kinds of problems:\n",

    "What if we could do the same with words? Before introducing the methodology of obtaining these vectors, it's relevant to discuss why word vectors are effective. One of the main reasons adoption is so widespread is because they can be **pretrained**. What this means is that we can use word vectors which have been trained on any corpus (e.g. Wikipedia, Twitter, medical journals, ancient religious texts etc.) in a potentially domain specific downstream task. For example, word vectors obtained by training on ancient religious texts might be used to classify ancient religious texts into a religion; or Twitter data can be used to generate conversation-like agents. That is, each word vector is just a vector to represent that word, and the algorithm we're using to solve the task at hand will learn the embeddings for all the words based on their context in the training corpus (e.g. the \"meaning\" of the word _lit_ would be different if comparing the vector based on a religious text and the vector based on Twitter).\n",

We could lowercase everything, but what issues can you see that causing? Semantic differences of Polish vs polish etc. What about the two different instances of `film` (`film...`)? Ok, we can remove punctuation, but wouldn't this ruin the `U.S.` acronym? Another solution would be to count `...` as a token, or remove it, but keep `.`s as part of the token if it is instantly followed by a letter (i.e. no space). This part of the pre-processing pipeline is called normalization. Let's do some basic normalization for now, and later on we'll use a library to do this for us ([regex] is a beast in itself).
